# Assessment

The following is a copy of the original Smartcar challenge doc, for my 
reference.

## Challenge

The Madeup Motors (MM) car company has a terrible API. It returns badly
structured JSON which isn't always consistent. Smartcar needs to adapt the API
into a cleaner format.

### Instructions

There are two API specifications provided below, the MM API and the Smartcar API Spec.
Your task is to implement the Smartcar spec by making HTTP requests to the MM API.

The flow looks like this:

    client --request--> Smartcar API --request--> MM API

Your tasks are as follows:

* Implement the Smartcar API specification using any frameworks or libraries as necessary
* Provide tests for your API implementation
* Write your code to be well structured and documented
